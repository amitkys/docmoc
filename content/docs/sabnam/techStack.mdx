## Core

- Next.js (TypeScript)
- Prisma (ORM)
- TailwindCSS (UI)
- Shadcn UI (Components)

## Why Next.js?

- It's full stack framework, we don't need to write backend & frontend separately.
- It supports [SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering), [CSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/client-side-rendering), and [Static Site Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation). Which is good for SEO.
- I've seen many successful startups and open-source projects built with Next.js, so it's exciting to explore it.

## Why TypeScript?

| Features                    | TS  | JS         |
| --------------------------- | --- | ---------- |
| `Static Type Checking`      | ✅  | ❌         |
| `Type Inference`            | ✅  | ❌         |
| `Interfaces & Type Aliases` | ✅  | ❌         |
| `Compile-time Error`        | ✅  | ❌         |
| `IDE Autocompletion`        | ✅  | ⚠️ Limited |

### What JS can't do

```ts title="index.ts"
interface IUser {
  name: string;
}

const user: IUser = {
  name: "kys",
};

function getUsername(user: IUser) {
  // After pressing [dot], we will get all properties of the user, i.e., name // [!code highlight]
  return user.name;
}
```
