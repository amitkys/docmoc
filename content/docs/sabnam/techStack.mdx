## Core

- Next.js (TypeScript)
- Prisma (ORM)
- TailwindCSS (UI)
- Shadcn UI (Components)

## Why Next.js?

- It's full stack framework, we don't need to write backend & frontend separately.
- It supports [SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering), [CSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/client-side-rendering), and [Static Site Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation). Which is good for SEO.
- I've seen many successful startups and open-source projects built with Next.js, so it's exciting to explore it.
